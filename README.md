# Passive-OSINT
This script uses a website that compiles many data brokers into one conveient portal. In an effort to strengthen my python abilities I created a python script that basically uses their backend to compile a report that is as accurate as possible. The site has some inconsistencies with what data it returns so the script will use the website twice and delete any duplicate data. The report's data is in no specific order. Supply some basic information following the format in the script.
